# Rulemaker

[Rulemaker](https://rulemaker.io) is a platform for writing version-controlled rules through direct democracy.

Rules are written collaboratively, with a complete revision history, so that everyone always knows exactly **who** wrote exactly **what**.

## Examples

### Civil Rights
1. The [NAACP](https://naacp.org), a civil rights organization, writes a `rule` outlining anti-discriminatory hiring practices
2. Executives at Google see this rule and decide to incorporate it into their hiring processes.
3. Google may choose to use any published `version` of the rule.
4. Google elects to use the `latest version` of the rule, thereby automatically incorporating any and all future changes made to the rule by the NAACP.
5. Google executives are passionate about this rule in particular, so they publically `endorse` it and claim to have `implemenmted` it on Rulemaker.
6. Google's competitors see Google's activity and also begin endorsing and implementing the rule.
7. Individuals begin stating publicly that they will only consider working for potential future employers that have implemented the rule.
8.  The rule becomes widely endorsed and adopted.
