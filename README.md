# [Rulemaker](https://rulemaker.io)

Let's face it. Decisions made by organizations are not always fair, and they don't always reflect the perspectives of the people that they impact. Leaders of many organizations make decisions under clouds of favoritism, nepotism, ignorance, discrimination, self-interest, or even flat out corruption. [Rulemaker](https://rulemaker.io) aims to combat these issues and empower <i>all people</i> by eliminating bureaucracy, increasing transparency, and providing every person with a voice during decision-making processes.

[Rulemaker](https://rulemaker.io) is a platform for writing and sharing version-controlled rules through direct democracy. Rules may be written collaboratively, with a complete revision history, so that everyone always knows exactly **who** wrote exactly **what**, **when**, and **why**. It's like git for policymaking, but without any technical know-how.

## Example use cases

### Civil Rights (adoption through endorsement)
1. <i>Civil Rights Org</i> writes a `rule` outlining anti-discriminatory hiring practices that <i>Civil Rights Org</i> believes all employers should follow.
2. Executives at <i>Big Tech Co</i> see this `rule` and decide to incorporate it into their hiring processes. <i>Big Tech Co</i> may choose from any published `version` of the `rule`.
3. <i>Big Tech Co</i> elects to adopt the `latest version` of the `rule`, thereby automatically incorporating any and all future changes made to the `rule` by <i>Civil Rights Org</i>.
4. <i>Big Tech Co</i> executives are passionate about this `rule` in particular, so they publically `endorse` it on Rulemaker. They also claim to have `implemented` this `rule` on Rulemaker.
5. <i>Big Tech Co's</i> competitors see this activity and also begin `endorsing` the `rule` and claiming to have `implemented` the `rule`.
6. High-profile individuals within the tech industry begin publicly `endorsing` the `rule` on Rulemaker.
7. Individuals begin stating publicly that they will only consider working for potential future employers that have `implemented` the rule.
8. The `rule` becomes widely adopted throughout the industry.

## Details - maybe turn this into an FAQ

### Async and online
- Explain that the whole platform is intended to be async and distributed... there should never be any time or space requirements for participation

### "Meta-rules"
So called "meta-rules" are no different from any other `rule`, but they are `rules` about `rules`.
- `Rules` can be written about other `rules`...
- `Rules` can incorporate other `rules` by reference

### Voting
- The most obvious initial application of "meta-rules": defining voting procedures. `Organizations` can develop their own voting procedures, or they can use a voting procedure defined by a rule (written by someone else)...
  - If a `rule` is specific to an `organization` and/or `location`, then the passage of the `rule` may require a majority vote from the individuals that live or work in/for the `organization` and/or `location`.

### Enforcement
- Rulemaker currently has no mechanism whatsoever for the enforcement of any `rules`

### Organizations
- An `organization` is **any** group of one or more people.
  - E.g. a country, a company, a club, a household, a person.
  - <i>All People</i> is the default `organization` for every new `rule`.
- A `rule` can be written/owned by an `organization`.
- A `rule` can be specific to one or more `organizations`.

### Locations
- A `location` is a specific place, defined by one or more geographic boundaries.
- a `location` can included other `locations` by reference.
- A `rule` can be specific to one or more `locations`.
  - Note: a `rule` can be simultaneously specific to an `organization` **and** a `location`.

### Permissions & publishing rules
- When a new `rule` is being written, its visibility may be limited to one or more `organizations`.
- Permissions may be specified for who is allowed to view, edit, and/or comment on the `rule` while it is being written.
- When the writing of the `rule` is complete, the `rule` may be `published`.
- A `rule's` viewing, editing, and commenting permissions can be different after the `rule` is `published`.

## Getting started
Explain that the platform is very flexible, orgs can adopt it incrementally, as needed, do any or all of the following:
- Use Rulemaker as a social media platform
  - Advertise your organization's values by `endorsing` and claiming to have `implemented` `rules` in your organization
- Write `rules` using collaboration tools
- Develop a voting procedure appropriate for your organization
- Implement policy based upon voting results
